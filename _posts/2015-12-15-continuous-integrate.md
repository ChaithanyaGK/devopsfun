## Provisioning Continuous Integration Solution
In the previous module, you learned how to manually push an application to a test environment from our local dev machine. Now what about running tests, deploy to staging and production, and checkstyle reports? In this module, we will look at how to setup and configure a Jenkins instance to create an end-to-end continuous integration pipeline for our Node.js application. We start the pipeline by integrating with GitHub to automatically trigger this CI pipeline to run when a change is pushed to GitHub.
